/* public class signinemailandpassworddontmatchCODE {
}


/*
 * This file contains the Java code needed to make the "Login Failed" screen work.
 * It uses the activity_login_failed.xml layout, which shows the error message
 * telling the user that their email or password was incorrect.
 *
 * BASIC CODE LOGIC INCLUDED IN THIS ACTIVITY:
 *
 * 1. Connect the XML UI elements to Java:
 *      - EditText for email and password
 *      - Sign In button
 *      - "Create Account" text link
 *
 * 2. When the user presses the Sign In button:
 *      - Read the email and password they typed
 *      - Check if the login information is correct
 *      - If correct: go to the HomeActivity
 *      - If incorrect: reload this same error screen
 *
 * 3. When the user taps "Create Account":
 *      - Open the RegisterActivity so they can sign up
 *
 * This is the basic code required to handle retrying the login
 * and letting the user create an account after a failed login attempt.
